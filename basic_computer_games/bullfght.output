                                  BULL
               CREATIVE COMPUTING  MORRISTOWN, NEW JERSEY



DO YOU WANT INSTRUCTIONS? YES
HELLO, ALL YOU BLOODLOVERS AND AFICIONADOS.
HERE IS YOUR BIG CHANCE TO KILL A BULL.

ON EACH PASS OF THE BULL, YOU MAY TRY
0 - VERONICA (DANGEROUS INSIDE MOVE OF THE CAPE)
1 - LESS DANGEROUS OUTSIDE MOVE OF THE CAPE
2 - ORDINARY SWIRL OF THE CAPE.

INSTEAD OF THE ABOVE, YOU MAY TRY TO KILL THE BULL
ON ANY TURN: 4 (OVER THE HORNS), 5 (IN THE CHEST).
BUT IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULDN'T TRY IT BEFORE THE SEVENTH PASS.

THE CROWD WILL DETERMINE WHAT AWARD YOU DESERVE
(POSTHUMOUSLY IF NECESSARY).
THE BRAVER YOU ARE, THE BETTER THE AWARD YOU RECIEVE.

THE BETTER THE JOB THE PICADORES AND TOREADORES DO,
THE BETTER YOUR CHANCES ARE.


YOU HAVE DRAWN A FAIR BULL.

THE PICADORES DID A GOOD JOB.

THE TOREADORES DID A FAIR JOB.



PASS NUMBER 1 
THE BULL IS CHARGING AT YOU!  YOU ARE THE MATADOR--
DO YOU WANT TO KILL THE BULL? YES

IT IS THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.

HOW DO YOU TRY TO KILL THE BULL? 0
YOU PANICKED.  THE BULL GORED YOU.

DO YOU RUN FROM THE RING? NO
YOU ARE BRAVE.  STUPID, BUT BRAVE.





THE CROWD CHEERS WILDLY!
THE CROWD AWARDS YOU
ONE EAR OF THE BULL.

ADIOS
