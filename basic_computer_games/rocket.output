LUNAR LANDING SIMULATION
----- ------- ----------

DO YOU WANT INSTRUCTIONS (YES OR NO)? YES

YOU ARE LANDING ON THE MOON AND AND HAVE TAKEN OVER MANUAL
CONTROL 1000 FEET ABOVE A GOOD LANDING SPOT. YOU HAVE A DOWN-
WARD VELOCITY OF 50 FEET/SEC. 150 UNITS OF FUEL REMAIN.

HERE ARE THE RULES THAT GOVERN YOUR APOLLO SPACE-CRAFT:

(1) AFTER EACH SECOND THE HEIGHT, VELOCITY, AND REMAINING FUEL
    WILL BE REPORTED VIA DIGBY YOUR ON-BOARD COMPUTER.
(2) AFTER THE REPORT A '?' WILL APPEAR. ENTER THE NUMBER
    OF UNITS OF FUEL YOU WISH TO BURN DURING THE NEXT
    SECOND. EACH UNIT OF FUEL WILL SLOW YOUR DESCENT BY
    1 FOOT/SEC.
(3) THE MAXIMUM THRUST OF YOUR ENGINE IS 30 FEET/SEC/SEC
    OR 30 UNITS OF FUEL PER SECOND.
(4) WHEN YOU CONTACT THE LUNAR SURFACE. YOUR DESCENT ENGINE
    WILL AUTOMATICALLY SHUT DOWN AND YOU WILL BE GIVEN A
    REPORT OF YOUR LANDING SPEED AND REMAINING FUEL.
(5) IF YOU RUN OUT OF FUEL THE '?' WILL NO LONGER APPEAR
    BUT YOUR SECOND BY SECOND REPORT WILL CONTINUE UNTIL
    YOU CONTACT THE LUNAR SURFACE.
