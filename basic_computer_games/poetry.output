MIDNIGHT DREARY
THING OF EVIL NEVER FLITTING

     SLOWLY CREEPING

MIDNIGHT DREARY
     NEVER FLITTING
QUOTH THE RAVEN
     NOTHING MORE 
BIRD OR FIEND NEVER FLITTING AND MY SOUL ...EVERMORE

BIRD OR FIEND NEVER FLITTING AND MY SOUL SLOWLY CREEPING

FIERY EYES
     THRILLED ME AND MY SOUL,
     NOTHING MORE 

BURNED
MIDNIGHT DREARY BURNED
AND MY SOUL YET AGAIN, 
MIDNIGHT DREARY THRILLED ME SHALL BE LIFTED ...EVERMORE,

MIDNIGHT DREARY BURNED,
DARKNESS THERE
     YET AGAIN 
FIERY EYES BURNED SIGN OF PARTING
     SLOWLY CREEPING

BIRD OR FIEND STILL SITTING.... AND MY SOUL
     YET AGAIN 

BEGUILING ME BIRD OR FIEND
     NEVER FLITTING
DARKNESS THERE
     NEVERMORE 
THING OF EVIL BURNED, AND MY SOUL
     SLOWLY CREEPING 
BIRD OR FIEND
     BURNED DARKNESS THERE SLOWLY CREEPING, 
THING OF EVIL BURNED AND MY SOUL YET AGAIN 
BIRD OR FIEND THRILLED ME SIGN OF PARTING YET AGAIN 

STILL SITTING.... THING OF EVIL BEGUILING ME,
SHALL BE LIFTED
