YOU ARE THE WEAPONS OFFICER ON THE STARSHIP ENTERPRISE
AND THIS IS A TEST TO SEE HOW ACCURATE A SHOT YOU
ARE IN A THREE-DIMENSIONAL RANGE.  YOU WILL BE TOLD
THE RADIAN OFFSET FOR THE X AND Z AXES, THE LOCATION
OF THE TARGET IN THREE DIMENSIONAL RECTANGULAR COORDINATES,
THE APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF DEGREES FROM THE X AND Z
AXES, AND THE APPROXIMATE DISTANCE TO THE TARGET.
YOU WILL THEN PROCEEED TO SHOOT AT THE TARGET UNTIL IT IS
DESTROYED!

GOOD LUCK!!
