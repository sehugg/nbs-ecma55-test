     THIS IS A TWO PERSON GAME CALLED 'EVEN WINS.'
TO PLAY THE GAME, THE PLAYERS NEED 27 MARBLES OR
OTHER OBJECTS ON A TABLE.


     THE 2 PLAYERS ALTERNATE TURNS, WITH EACH PLAYER
REMOVING FROM 1 TO 4 MARBLES ON EACH MOVE.  THE GAME
ENDS WHEN THERE ARE NO MARBLES LEFT, AND THE WINNER
IS THE ONE WITH AN EVEN NUMBER OF MARBLES.


     THE ONLY RULES ARE THAT (1) YOU MUST ALTERNATE TURNS,
(2) YOU MUST TAKE BETWEEN 1 AND 4 MARBLES EACH TURN,
AND (3) YOU CANNOT SKIP A TURN.
