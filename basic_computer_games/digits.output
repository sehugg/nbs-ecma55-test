THIS IS A GAME OF GUESSING.
FOR INSTRUCTIONS, TYPE '1', ELSE TYPE '0'? 1

PLEASE TAKE A PIECE OF PAPER AND WRITE DOWN
THE DIGITS '0', '1', OR '2' THIRTY TIMES AT RANDOM.
ARRANGE THEM IN THREE LINES OF TEN DIGITS EACH.
I WILL ASK FOR THEN TEN AT A TIME.
I WILL ALWAYS GUESS THEM FIRST AND THEN LOOK AT YOUR
NEXT NUMBER TO SEE IF I WAS RIGHT. BY PURE LUCK,
I OUGHT TO BE RIGHT TEN TIMES. BUT I HOPE TO DO BETTER
THAN THAT *****
